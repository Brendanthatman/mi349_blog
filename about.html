            <p>I am 22 years old, and I have lived all my life in West Michigan. I have an amazingly wide variety of interests, including: technology, airplanes, automobiles, travelling, photography and random facts. I’m not quite sure how I stumble upon all these hobbies and interests, but they somehow get into my life. I always love to take my camera new places and see new things, to live in the moment and take in all the scenery. This plays well into travelling, as it allows me to go all sorts of places and experience these new things.</p>
            <p>Planes, trains and automobiles? Yeah, that’s a great movie, but also things I greatly enjoy knowledge about. I am always full of random facts about these machines, and they’re all truly amazing wonders that make up modern society as it is today. I also enjoy the photography aspect that comes from these machines, and I have SD cards full of these. They’re all so cool, I can’t help myself!</p>
            <p>Technology, now that’s a broad subject. I love it, but it can get very expensive real quick. Ah well, it’s fun! I enjoy building new computers and having things to mess with. Also plays into the photography aspect, as cameras have evolved greatly just in my time of being alive. </p>
            <p>Some quick stats:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Countries visited: 22</li>
                <li>Miles flown (total): 67,391</li>
                <li>Computers built (including for work): 7</li>
                <li>Favorite car driven: 2023 Audi A3 TDI</li>
            </ul>
