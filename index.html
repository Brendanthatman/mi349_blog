            <h3>A recent trip to Iceland reveals great beauty among the landscape...</h3>
            <p>I recently got back from a wonderful trip to the beautiful country of Iceland. It is one of my favorite countries in the world to visit for its scenery, as there is so much of it to see. Being there for only a week only meant seeing a fraction of the island, and there is so much more to see. Volcano landscapes dominate this vast island nation, leading to scenes of desert, rock and snow capped mountains all in one beautiful area. One of my favorite pictures there is featured here, which is a really cool volcanic rock formation on the side of a cliff. This was a beautiful spot to have lunch, a classic fish and chips, of which I had more than three times while I was there. One of those places where the fish is always fresh and ready to go! You’ll also meet people from all ends of the Earth there, as it is a huge tourist spot for people of all nations. That being said, you’ll also find that there are a good amount of international and local food palate there – you’ll surely never go hungry. With lower-cost airlines such as Icelandair offering many flights every day from many locations to this wonderful island, now is a great opportunity to book your next vacation!</p>

            <h3>Apple CarPlay has gotten even better than before...</h3>
            <p>In Apple’s latest iOS 18 update, recently released in late September to all eligible iOS devices, they updated the interface for Apple CarPlay, their compatible vehicle phone projection interface. Within this update and interface change, they changed the icon of the “home button” to reflect that of the classic iPhones, iPads and iPods with a non-Touch ID home button. This shape is seen in the lower left corner of the interface, in the form of a square with rounded edges. I greatly appreciate this gesture by Apple, as I really enjoy seeing retro things from my younger life being brought into the present and re-utilized. My very first Apple devices were iPods and iPads with this very home button style, so seeing this in Apple CarPlay when I’ve matured a bit and have a recent iPhone brings me great joy. I appreciate this effort by technology companies, as it shows they are still thinking about their past and current users coming together. With these retro touches also comes some polishing of the CarPlay interface, including making the album artwork bigger for music, new wallpapers, and some newer app compatibility. If your vehicle is compatible with Apple CarPlay, or if you want to check out some other great new features, such as RCS messaging, you should update your iPhone to iOS 18 today to get all the greatest tech!</p>
