            <p>I recently got back from a wonderful trip to the beautiful country of Iceland. It is one of my favorite countries in the world to visit for its scenery, as there is so much of it to see. Being there for only a week only meant seeing a fraction of the island, and there is so much more to see. Volcano landscapes dominate this vast island nation, leading to scenes of desert, rock and snow capped mountains all in one beautiful area. One of my favorite pictures there is featured here, which is a really cool volcanic rock formation on the side of a cliff. This was a beautiful spot to have lunch, a classic fish and chips, of which I had more than three times while I was there. One of those places where the fish is always fresh and ready to go! You’ll also meet people from all ends of the Earth there, as it is a huge tourist spot for people of all nations. That being said, you’ll also find that there are a good amount of international and local food palate there – you’ll surely never go hungry. With lower-cost airlines such as Icelandair offering many flights every day from many locations to this wonderful island, now is a great opportunity to book your next vacation!</p>
